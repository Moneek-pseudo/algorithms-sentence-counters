# Sentence Analyzer – Beginner Algorithm Exercise

## 📝 Objective

Write a simple program that analyzes a sentence and counts:

- Total number of **characters**
- Total number of **words** (words are separated by single spaces)
- Total number of **vowels** (both uppercase and lowercase)

The sentence must end with a **period (`.`)**. Each character should be processed individually using loop and conditionals.

## 📌 Requirements

- Use **three counter variables**: one each for characters, words, and vowels.
- Assume clean input: words separated by **single spaces**, ending with a period.
- Treat vowels as: `a, e, i, o, u` (both lowercase and uppercase)

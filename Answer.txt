4. Declare a variable for vowels: vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
5. Loop through each character in the sentence:
    a. Increase sentence_length by 1
    b. If character is a space, increase word_counter by 1
    c. If character is in vowels, increase vowel_counter by 1
6. After loop ends, print sentence_length, word_counter, and vowel_counter
